  "title": "Fix LocalExecutor memory spike by applying gc.freeze",
  "body": "related: https://github.com/apache/airflow/discussions/58143\r\n\r\n### Body\r\nAs discussed (not confirmed yet), this resolves the issue of sudden memory usage spikes in worker processes when using LocalExecutor. Memory increases due to unnecessary copying of read-only shared memory through COW caused by gc. By applying gc.freeze and moving existing objects to the permanent generation, we prevent COW from occurring.\r\n\r\nWhen using fork mode, we create many worker processes at once to minimize gc.freeze and unfreeze calls. When using spawn mode, we maintain the existing approach to ensure stability.\r\n\r\n### Benchmark\r\n\r\n#### memory usage\r\nComparison of per-process memory usage in LocalExecutor before and after applying this PR. Measured in the same environment running 500 tasks per minute for 12 hours.\r\n| AS-IS | TO-BE |\r\n|-------|-------|\r\n| [smem_as-is.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23567938/smem_as-is.txt) | [smem_to-be.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23567942/smem_to-be.txt) |\r\n| <img width=\"400\" alt=\"AS-IS\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53e6122a-5b39-46c6-a862-b635d53d3993\" /> | <img width=\"400\" alt=\"TO-BE\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9796032f-6d8d-4234-91eb-e2aa186381ba\" /> |\r\n\r\n#### gc.freeze / unfreeze performance (elapsed time)\r\nWe measured the elapsed time of gc.freeze and gc.unfreeze for each scheduler loop iteration. Most operations took microseconds, confirming virtually no impact. The actual operation is a very lightweight process that simply marks objects in the current generation as permanent generation without any memory copying.https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/3705/files\r\n```\r\n[airflow.jobs.scheduler_job_runner.SchedulerJobRunner] loc=scheduler_job_runner.py:1375\r\n2025-11-15T05:13:36.911715Z [info     ] freeze: 18.83 \u03bcs               [airflow.jobs.scheduler_job_runner.SchedulerJobRunner] loc=scheduler_job_runner.py:1366\r\n2025-11-15T05:13:36.912238Z [info     ] freeze_cpu: 10.08 \u03bcs           [airflow.jobs.scheduler_job_runner.SchedulerJobRunner] loc=scheduler_job_runner.py:1367\r\n2025-11-15T05:13:36.912517Z [info     ] unfreeze: 10.92 \u03bcs             [airflow.jobs.scheduler_job_runner.SchedulerJobRunner] loc=scheduler_job_runner.py:1374\r\n2025-11-15T05:13:36.913268Z [info     ] unfreeze_cpu: 6.87 \u03bcs  \r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.
